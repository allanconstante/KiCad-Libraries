KiCad_Libraries
===============

My KiCad libraries. Symbols are based on IEEE Std 315-1975, and IEC 60617. Land Patterns are based on IPC-7x51

Acknowledgements
================
Some of the libraries and 3D Models have been based on others found the web. My libraries could not be created without the tools and libraries
created by others and of course the KiCad developers and community:

General
=======
These KiCad libraries were initially created over a period of 3 years and work is ongoing.
The aim has been to create Symbols and Land Patterns that conform to standards such as IEEE Std 315-1975, IEC 60617 and IPC-7x51.

Symbols
=======
 - See "Vol1_Symbols_Guideline.pdf" under "Documents" for descriptions of library structure, naming convention and "rules"
on how the symbols are created.
 - Designations try to follow IEEE Std 315-1975, Symbols try to follow IEC 60617.
 - Note: Some library files are empty (not implemented yet).

Land Patterns
=============
 - See "Vol2_LandPatterns_Guideline.pdf" under "Documents" for descriptions of library structure, naming convention and "rules"
on how the Land Patterns are created.
 - Naming conventions and Land Patterns try to follow IPC-7x51.
 - Note: Some library files are empty (not implemented yet).
